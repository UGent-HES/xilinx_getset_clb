## Xilinx LUT editing functions

This repository contains the source code to read and edit the LUT contents of CLBs on the Virtex 5 and Zynq. Other architectures can probably be supported with minimal changes.

This serves as a replacement for the XHwIcap_GetClbBits and XHwIcap_SetClbBits functions provided by Xilinx.
